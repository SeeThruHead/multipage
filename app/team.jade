    h3 SUPERPEDESTRIAN INC
    p Superpedestrian brings together a team of designers and robotics engineers with one vision: transforming urban mobility. Our first idea? Pedal power. With an exclusive license to MITâ€™s Copenhagen Wheel, we bring the bike revolution to your streets. The Copenhagen Wheel is entering mass production in 2014, with thousands of units already sold on pre-order. Superpedestrian operates out of Cambridge, Massachusetts. It was founded in late 2012 by co-inventor of the Copenhagen Wheel, and backed by tier-one venture capital investors.
